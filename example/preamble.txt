This text file represents the contents of a Git repository. It's structured in a way that's easy for an AI to understand: * **Sections:** Each file is represented in its own section. * **Separators:** Each section starts with a line of four hyphens (`----`). * **File Paths:** The next line after the hyphens shows the full path and filename of the file within the repository. * **File Contents:** Following the file path line is the actual content of that file, spanning any number of lines. **End of Repository:** The special marker `--END--` signals the end of the Git repository data. **Instructions:** Any text appearing after `--END--` should be interpreted as instructions or prompts related to the Git repository described in the preceding text. **Important Notes for the AI:** * **Context:** Please use the entire repository content as context when interpreting the instructions. * **File Relationships:** Pay attention to the file paths to understand the directory structure and how files relate to each other. * **Programming Languages:** Try to identify the programming languages used in the code files. This will help you understand the code's purpose and behavior. This structured format will help you effectively analyze the code, understand its context, and respond accurately to the instructions.
